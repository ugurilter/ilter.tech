## HTB Cyber Apocalypse CTF

I came accross a new CTF on [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/) today and decided to give it a try for fun.

The CTF is called [Cyber Apocalypse: The Cursed Mission](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/event/details/cyber-apocalypse-2023-the-cursed-mission-821) and is being hosted by HackTheBox organization.
It's an online CTF competition with a format called 'Jeopardy' where you need to solve 74 challenges out of 10 different categories. Prize pool is 35K USD.

Currently there seems to be 6K+ teams registered with a total of 11K+ players.

I'll share my write-ups here if i can solve any challenges :)

Wish me luck !
